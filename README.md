## How I work

I don't chase frameworks. I solve problems.

Every line of code I write serves a business need. No vanity metrics. No over-engineering. Just solutions that scale and make money.

**My stack today:** Laravel • React • Angular • PostgreSQL • Docker

I pick tools that get the job done elegantly, then move fast.

## Selected work

### 🏥 GuiPharma
Complete pharmacy operations platform for West African retail pharmacies.

**Impact:** 40% fewer stock errors, automated expiry tracking, 3x faster prescription processing

**Built with:** Laravel • React • MySQL • Real-time inventory sync

**The challenge:** Pharmacies were losing thousands monthly to expired stock and manual errors. Built a system that actually fits how they work, not Silicon Valley workflows.

---

### 🎯 AI Recruitment Platform
End-to-end hiring solution with intelligent candidate matching.

**Scale:** 500+ active candidates, 50+ companies, real-time analytics dashboard

**Built with:** Laravel API • Angular • PostgreSQL • JWT auth

**The challenge:** West African recruiters needed local-first tools, not expensive Western SaaS with features they don't use.

---

### 🎓 School Management System
Complete platform for student enrollment, grades, schedules, and parent communication.

**Built with:** Spring Boot • Angular • MySQL

**The challenge:** Schools needed affordable, offline-capable solutions. We delivered both.

---

### 🤖 RAG Chatbot
Customer service automation using retrieval-augmented generation.

**Built with:** Python • FastAPI • LangChain

**The challenge:** E-commerce sites needed support that speaks local languages and understands local context.

## BIAcode

I co-founded BIAcode to prove that world-class software can be built from Africa, for Africa.

**What we do:**
- Custom web & mobile applications
- SaaS products for emerging markets
- Business management systems (ERP, CRM, inventory)
- Digital transformation consulting

**Our approach:** Local-first design. Offline-capable when needed. Built for real constraints, not ideal scenarios.

**Sectors we've shipped for:** Healthcare, education, retail, e-commerce, recruitment

## Stack philosophy

**Backend:** Laravel (API design, auth, clean architecture), Spring Boot (microservices), Python (AI/ML, automation)

**Frontend:** React, Angular, TypeScript — whatever fits the project timeline and team

**Data:** PostgreSQL for complex queries, MySQL for speed, Redis when caching matters

**Infrastructure:** Docker, Linux, Git — CI/CD in progress

I'm framework-agnostic. I care about shipping, not religious wars over tools.

## My principles

**1. Ship > Perfect**  
Done and deployed beats beautiful and stuck in development.

**2. Local context matters**  
Solutions built for California don't always work in Dakar. Build for the reality you're in.

**3. Impact over code**  
The best code is the code that solves the problem. Elegance is a bonus.

**4. Build to scale**  
Think ahead, but don't over-engineer. Most apps don't need Kubernetes on day one.
